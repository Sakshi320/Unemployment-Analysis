# Unemployment-Analysis


Project Description:
The unemployed are people of working age who are without work, are available for work, and have taken specific steps to find work. Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate, which is the number of jobless people as a percentage of the labor force. I am going to evaluate the unemployment rate across the world and my aim is to provide the trends of unemployment based on the education level, gender, state, and ethnicity.

Dataset Exploration:
For my project, I have collected dataset for various USA regions, and integrated different datasets to explore what reasons are causing this unemployment. I have also looked at the gender statistics in the dataset to see which gender has the most unemployment rate. Moreover I have bifurcated unemployment rates based on the information on unemployment rates by education level, age, state as well as ethnicity. Further I have talked about how we can improve the unemployment.
